You can use "label_mental_load_level_factorized" column as the label and the "user_id" column for the Adaptation/Personalization column.
You should also remove other labels in the dataset (i.e., "label_task_class label_mental_load_level label_task_type label_task_class_factorized" using "Columns to be initially removed" field from the "Data Preprocessing" tab.
